Severity Level,Message,Count
3,Use of weak SHA1 hash for security. Consider usedforsecurity=False,10
3,"subprocess call with shell=True identified, security issue.",5
3,The pyCrypto library and its module AES are no longer actively maintained and have been deprecated. Consider using pyca/cryptography library.,1
3,Use of weak MD5 hash for security. Consider usedforsecurity=False,1
2,Possible SQL injection vector through string-based query construction.,33
2,Use of exec detected.,12
2,Use of possibly insecure function - consider using safer ast.literal_eval.,8
2,Probable insecure usage of temp file/directory.,5
2,Audit url open for permitted schemes. Allowing use of file:/ or custom schemes is often unexpected.,2

1,Starting a process with a partial executable path,32
1,Consider possible security implications associated with the subprocess module.,29
1,"Try, Except, Continue detected.",27
1,Standard pseudo-random generators are not suitable for security/cryptographic purposes.,6
1,Use of assert detected. The enclosed code will be removed when compiling to optimised byte code.,6
1,"Using escape to parse untrusted XML data is known to be vulnerable to XML attacks. Replace escape with the equivalent defusedxml package, or make sure defusedxml.defuse_stdlib() is called.",3
1,Starting a process without a shell.,2
